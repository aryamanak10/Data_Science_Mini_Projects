# Data_Science_Mini_Projects
These are some mini projects made my me to understand and implement the Machine Learning Models.

These files have an extension of .ipynb format which is the Python Notebook format. I have choosed this format because Jupyter or Google
Collab IDE's have files saved with these extensions. These 2 IDE's have the best format for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects.

So, if you want to view these files it will be better if you view these files with these 2 IDE's as it will be more comfortable for you.
